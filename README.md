# Neat Technical Writing Resources

These are just some of the resources that I personally read, use, and find helpful. 

## Books
* [Docs for Developers: An Engineer's Field Guide to Technical Writing](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/docs-for-developers/9781484272176/): Fantastic read for writers already familiar/comfortable with software development terms and concepts. 
* [Docs Like Code](https://www.docslikecode.com/): Gets a bit more technical but does a good job of covering version control and automation.


## Communities 
* [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/): The first thing you should do after figuring out whether or not you're interested in technical writing is join this community, introduce yourself, and browse the slack channels. 
  * **Bonus**: Attend conferences! 

## Courses
* [Google's Technical Writing Courses 1 & 2](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing)

## Markup Languages
Learning a markup language is one of the easiest things you can do that will get you closer to being a technical writer. Start with HTML or Markdown before checking out XML (unless you don't want to, I'm not your boss). 

### HTML
* [MDN HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [W3 Schools HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

### Markdown
* [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
* [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/): If you're already on GitHub, you probably won't need this, but having an in-browser Markdown editor can be convenient when you don't want to create a gist. 

### XML
* [W3 Schools XML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/)
* [What is DITA?](https://www.xml.com/articles/2017/01/19/what-dita/)

## Style Guides
If you're working solo or at a start-up without an in-house style guide, ~~store-bought is fine~~ using an existing one is a-okay.  
* [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
* [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style)

### Other style guides you're probably already familiar with
* [The Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html)
* [APA Style Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/)

## Tools 
> **Disclaimer**: Still trying these out but they seem neat so far. 
* **Prose Linter**: [Vale](https://vale.sh/) 
* **Documentation Theme**: [Read the Docs Sphinx](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/demo/structure.html)

## Websites
